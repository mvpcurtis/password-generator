# JavaScript Random Password Generator

## Description

This weeks module challenge marked a big leap forward in JavaScript learning about data structures and their methods as well as diving into functions. In this project, I've created a random password generator to help the user generate a random password. Security in todays world is essential and one thing I see over and over again is people close to me using the same, simple password across multiple accounts.

If there's one thing you can do to protect yourself against malicious people out there is to use a secure password. Passwords that are a lot harder to crack and that have no tie to your personal life! This is where this little project can come in handy for you.

## Usage

Once you're on the page, click the 'generate' button at the bottom. Multiple pop-ups will show to ask you for you preference in generating a password. An example, an pop-up box will show 'to ask if you'd like to include numbers in your password'. Either press the 'confirm' button if you would or the 'cancel' button if you wouldn't. As simple as that!
